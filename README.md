# Rabbit

Rabbit synchronizes videos between partners

To start:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get && npm install`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/files`](http://localhost:4000/files) from your browser.
Add a video of your choosing by clicking on the "New file" link on the bottom.


The `Url` field refers to the url at which you wish to view the video with a partner.
For example, "example" would result in a video being streamed at "http://localhost:4000/video/example"


The `Location` field refers to the location of the video file on the disk.


The `Content type` can be one of two strings `video/webm` and `video/mp4.`
